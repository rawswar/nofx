# Validation Status: sync/upstream-tinkle-community-nofx-main-resolve-conflicts-e2e

## Summary
The current environment does not have outbound network access or Docker support. As a result, the upstream synchronization and full end-to-end validation steps documented in the ticket cannot be executed directly from this workspace. This report captures the verifications that were possible and enumerates the outstanding actions that must be completed in a fully provisioned environment.

## Repository State
- Working tree is clean (`git status`).
- Active branch: `sync/upstream-tinkle-community-nofx-main-resolve-conflicts-e2e`.
- Existing artifacts (e.g., `artifacts/DIFF_REPORT.md`, `CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_AND_TEST_REPORT.md`) already summarize the previous reconciliation effort between the fork and upstream.

## Constraints Observed
| Capability | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| Git upstream fetch | üö´ Blocked | GitHub access is not available; cannot verify latest `tinkle-community/nofx` state or generate a fresh diff. |
| Docker engine | üö´ Blocked | Docker daemon is not present; PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB services and end-to-end compose flows cannot be exercised. |
| External HTTP calls | üö´ Blocked | API smoke tests against running containers and feature flag toggles require network-enabled services. |
| Long-running CI tools | ‚ö†Ô∏è Deferred | Per platform policy, linting/tests will run via the finish step; manual invocations were not performed. |

## Actions Performed Here
1. Verified repository cleanliness (`git status`).
2. Inspected existing diff and conflict-resolution artifacts to confirm prior reconciliation context.
3. Documented the blockers preventing upstream sync and full validation so the next maintainer can execute them in an unrestricted environment.

## Outstanding Actions (Requires Network + Docker)
1. **Upstream synchronization**
   - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/tinkle-community/nofx.git`
   - `git fetch upstream --tags --prune`
   - Update the integration branch from `upstream/main` and replay fork commits via cherry-pick or merge.
2. **Artifact regeneration**
   - Re-run diff commands to refresh `DIFF_REPORT.md` and capture any newly diverged files.
   - Update conflict resolution notes if additional merges introduce new decisions.
3. **Validation matrix**
   - `go vet`, `golangci-lint` (if configured), `go build ./...`
   - Non-DB CI: `DISABLE_DB_TESTS=1 GOFLAGS='-tags=nodocker' ./scripts/ci_test.sh`
   - DB + race suites with Docker-backed PostgreSQL (`TEST_DB_URL=...`).
   - `go test -race ./...`.
4. **End-to-end deployment**
   - `docker compose up -d` for backend + TimescaleDB + frontend.
   - Exercise `/health`, `/admin/feature-flags`, guarded stop-loss flows, and persistence checkpoints.
   - Capture logs, coverage summaries, and screenshots as ticket artifacts.
5. **PR submission**
   - Push the updated integration branch to the fork.
   - Open a PR against `tinkle-community/nofx:main` summarizing conflict resolutions, feature set, default flag states, test matrix, deployment verification, and rollback plan.

## Next Steps for Maintainers
Execute the outstanding actions in an environment with network and container capabilities. Update the artifacts accordingly and proceed with PR submission.
